## State Adoption of Alternate Academic Achievement Standards for SWSCD

The Oregon Extended assessment (ORExt), Oregon's Alternate Assessment based on
Alternate Academic Achievement Standards (AA-AAAS), is part of the Oregon
Statewide Assessment System. The ORExt is administered to Oregon students with
the most significant cognitive disabilities (SWSCD) in English language arts and
mathematics in Grades 3-8 and 11. The ORExt is administered in science in Grades
5, 8, & 11. The ORExt links to the CCSS in English language arts and
mathematics. The new ORExt is dually linked to Oregon's former science
standards, as well as to the NGSS. Results from the English language arts and
math administrations are included in calculations of participation and
performance for Annual Measurable Objectives (AMO) - a provision of the No Child
Left Behind Act (NCLB). Science participation is also included as part of the
Title 1 Assessment System requirements, and is administered in grades 5, 8, &
11. The revised ORExt is built upon a vertical scale in order to support
reliable determinations of annual academic growth in ELA and mathematics in
Grades 3-8. The complete vertical scaling plan and operational item selection
decision rules are located in *Appendix* 2.2.1.

### 6.1A State Formally Adopted Alternate Academic Achievement Standards {.unnumbered}

The State Board of Education formally adopted the AAAS and achievement level
descriptors (ALDs) on June 25, 2015 (see *Appendix* 6.1A.1). The ELA, Math, and
Science AAAS, including both the ALDs and the requisite cut scores are included
in *Appendix* 6.1.A.2.

### 6.1B State Applies AAAS to All Public School SWSCD in Tested Grades {.unnumbered}

The state applies the AAAS to all public school-served SWSCD who participate in
the ORExt in Grades 3-8 & 11 in English language arts and mathematics, and in
Grades 5, 8, & 11 in science.

### 6.1C State's AAAS Include At Least Three Levels, ALDs, and Cut Scores {.unnumbered}

The alternate academic achievement standards in Oregon are composed of four
levels (though only three are required). In descending order, they are (a) Level
1, (b) Level 2, (c) Level 3, and (d) Level 4. Level 1 and Level 2 performances
represent proficient achievement, while the bottom two levels represent
achievement that is not yet proficient. The procedures followed to develop
Oregon's alternate academic achievement standards were consistent with Title 1
assessment system requirements, including the establishment of cut scores, where
relevant. In order to define four levels of proficiency, Oregon set three cut
scores across all subject areas: (a) to separate Level 1 from Level 2, (b) to
separate Level 2 from Level 3, and, (c) to separate Level 3 from Level 4. The
alternate academic achievement standards in English language arts, mathematics,
and science for the ORExt, including the achievement level descriptors (ALDs)
and cut scores, were established during standard setting meetings held on June
15 (science), 16 (mathematics), and 17 (English language arts).

## Achievement Standard Setting

Standard Setting meetings were held at the University of Oregon in Eugene, OR on
June 15, 2015 (Science), June 16, 2015 (Mathematics), and June 17, 2015 (English
language arts). A total of 53 standard setters were involved in the process: 11
in Science, and 21 in both English language arts and Mathematics. Panelists were
assembled in grade level teams of three, where two members were special
educators and one member was a content specialist.

The panelists were highly educated. Over 90% of the panel possessed a Master's
degree or higher. Fifty-seven (57%) percent of the panelists had over 11 years
of teaching experience. Seventy-six percent (76%) of the panelists had some
experience working with students with significant cognitive disabilities with
64% licensed as Special Educators. The majority of panel members were female
(87%), from the Northwest of the state (87%), and White (83%). No panel member
self-identified with Oregon's major minority population (Hispanic).

In addition to the live training during standard setting meetings, panelists
were asked to complete several training requirements prior to the standard
setting meetings, which oriented them to the student population of students with
significant cognitive disabilities (SWSCDs), the Oregon Extended Assessment test
design and history, as well as the bookmarking standard setting method.
Panelists were quite confident in their preparation and final judgments, as
evidenced by responses to the questions: (a) " The training helped me understand
the bookmark method and how to perform my role as a standard setter." (b) "I am
confident about the defensibility and appropriateness of the final recommended
cut scores." and, (c) "Overall, I am confident that the standard setting
procedures allowed me to use my experience and expertise to recommend cut scores
for the ORExt." The hearty majority of standard setters strongly agreed with
these statements, while all participants agreed.

The nine-step process implemented for these standard setting meetings was based
on Hambleton & Pitoniak (2006) as reported by R.L. Brennan (Educational
Measurement, 4th Edition, pp. 433-470). Standard setting evaluation questions
posed to participants were adapted from Cizek's Setting Performance Standards
(2012). Standard setters set cut scores and recommended Achievement Level
Descriptors (ALDs) for the Oregon State Board of Education to consider. The cut
scores were articulated to reflect vertical development, or at least
maintenance, of expectations across grades in a manner that respected standard
setter judgments to the greatest possible degree. Six changes were made in ELA
and Mathematics. Science is not built upon a vertical scale, so no cut score
adjustments were necessary in Science. The cut scores are listed below.

Note: The ELA and Math vertical scales for the ORExt are centered on 200 in
grades 3-8 and can be used to document year-to-year growth. None of the other
scales should be used for longitudinal comparisons. All Grade 11 scales are
independent and centered on 900. The grade 5 Science scale is independent and
centered on 500, while the Grade 8 Science scale is independent and centered on
800. An independent auditor evaluated the bookmarking standard setting process.
The auditor's comprehensive report can be found in *Appendix* 6.2.2.

## Challenging and Aligned Academic Achievement Standards

Oregon educators initially evaluated new Oregon Essentialized Assessment
Frameworks in two respects. First, educators were asked to determine the
appropriateness of the standards selected for inclusion and exclusion in the
Essentialized Standards (yes/no). Second, the level of linkage between the
Essentialized Standards and grade level content standard was evaluated (0 = no
link, 1 = sufficient link, 2 = strong link). Summary results are provided in the
tables below. A comprehensive essentialized standard to grade level standard
linkage study, as well as essentialized standard to item alignment study, is
provided in *Appendix* 3.1A.

## Reporting

Oregon's reporting system facilitates appropriate, credible, and defensible
interpretation and use of its assessment data. With regard to the ORExt, the
purpose is to provide the state technically adequate student performance data to
ascertain proficiency on grade level state content standards for students with
significant cognitive disabilities (see Sections 3 and 4). In addition, the
state makes it clear that results from the Oregon Extended are not comparable to
results from the SBA/OAKS (see *Appendix* 2.3, p. 29-31). Nevertheless, the test
meets rigorous reliability expectations (see Section 4.1). Validity is
considered here as an overarching summation of the Oregon Extended assessment
system, as well as the mechanisms that Oregon uses to continuously improve the
ORExt assessment (see *Appendix* 2.3B.10).

### 6.4A Public Reporting {.unnumbered}

Oregon reports participation and assessment results for all students and for
each of the required subgroups in its reports at the school, district, and state
levels. The state does not report subgroup results when these results would
reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student. The
calculation rule followed is that the number of students in the subgroup must
meet the minimum cell size requirement for each AMO decision: participation,
achievement in English language arts and math, attendance, and graduation, where
appropriate (see *Appendix* 2.6C).

### 6.4B State Reports Interpretable Results {.unnumbered}

Oregon develops and disseminates individual student data upon final
determination of accuracy. The state provides districts with individual student
reports (ISRs) that meet most relevant requirements. The state incorporated the
Standard Error of Measure (SEM) for each student score into the report
templates. The SEM associated with each cut score is provided in Section 4.1B.
Also, see the mock-up ISR in *Appendix* 6.4C.

### 6.4C State Provides Individual Student Reports {.unnumbered}

Oregon's student reports provide valid and reliable information regarding
achievement on the assessments relative to the AAS. The reliability of the data
is addressed in Section 4.1. Validity is considered here as an overarching
summation of the Oregon Extended assessment system, as well as the mechanisms
that Oregon uses to continuously improve the Oregon Extended assessment. The
ISRs clearly demonstrate the students' scale score relative the AAAS that is
relevant for that content area and grade level (see Section 4.4 and *Appendix*
6.4C). The Oregon ISRs provide information for parents, teachers, and
administrators to help them understand and address a student's academic needs.
These reports are displayed in a simple format that is easy for stakeholders to
understand. District representatives can translate results for parents as
necessary. Scaled score interpretation guidance is published in *Appendix* 2.1A.

# Conclusions and Next Steps

In sum, the rigor of the procedural development and statistical outcomes of the
ORExt were substantive and support the assessments intended purpose. Procedural
evidence includes essentialized standards development, item development, item
content and bias reviews, an independent alignment study and item selection
based upon item characteristics. Outcome-related evidence included measure
reliability analyses, point measure biserials, outfit mean squares, item
difficulty and person ability distributions, and convergent and divergent
validity evidence. These sources of evidence were all quite good and provide
important validity evidence.

The test development process adhered to procedural guidelines defined by the
AERA/APA/NCME Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (2014), as
well as incorporating procedures that are known in the field to be best
practice. For example, an independent auditor evaluated alignment in 2016-17.
Documentation collected in the alignment study report suggests that the ORExt
assessment system is aligned based on five evaluation components: a) standard
selection for essentialization, b) strength of linkage between essentialized
standards and grade level content standards, c) alignment between items and
essentialized standards, d) alignment between the essentialized standards and
the achievement level descriptors, and e) alignment between the achievement
level descriptors and the ORExt test items. In addition, the ORExt reflects what
highly qualified Oregon educators believe represents the highest professional
standards for the population of students with significant cognitive
disabilities, as evidenced in our consequential validity study by teacher
support of the academic content on the ORExt as well as the behaviors sampled
during test administration.

The test reliabilities for the ORExt were quite high, suggesting that the
assessment items functioned consistently with the test as a whole. The
correlations between students' content scores across subjects were not overly
strong, implying that each test measures a distinct construct. The
classification consistency analyses demonstrate that the ORExt is appropriately
categorizing students into the proficient category, and capable of doing so in a
consistent manner. The vertical scale developed in 2014-15 appears to be
modeling incremental growth across Grades 3-8 in ELA and mathematics, as
intended. The Grade 7 mathematics test demonstrated sufficient item difficulties
across the ranges medium and high item complexity. However, low level items must
again be amended in the 2018-19 school year. The ELA and science assessments
could continue to benefit from the addition of more difficult items, as
evidenced by comparisons of the average person abilities and item difficulties.
Mathematics assessments appear to be functioning quite well in terms of person
abilities and item difficulties.

The Oregon Observational Rating Assessment (ORora) results demonstrate that
approximately 17-25% of the SWSCD who participated in the ORExt also took the
ORora, depending upon grade level. A total of 529 students were administered the
ORora in 2017-2018 school year. The participants were primarily students with
multiple, severe disabilities with very limited communication systems. Analyses
of missing data patterns for the ORExt demonstrated that QAs were generally able
to adhere to the discontinuation rules. Quantitative results indicate that a
total of 529 students across all tested grades were administered the ORora.
Response patterns on the ORExt were compared to ORora results to determine what
percentages of QAs were administering the ORora due to the minimum participation
rule and what percentage were administering the ORora of their own volition.
Analyses showed that 480 students were eligible to take the ORora in English
language arts, 466 students were eligible to take the ORora in mathematics, and
86 were eligible to take the ORora in science. This means that about 30 students
per grade, per content area received five or fewer correct responses within the
first 15 items administered on the ORExt. Of the 600 test records that met ORora
eligibility requirements, 71 were not administered the ORora. In addition, there
were 62 students in ELA and Math, respectively, who were administered the ORora
without having participated in the ORExt (54 of those students were the same
students, across each content area, with eight students unique to each content
area, respectively).

The 2017-18 Oregon Consequential Validity study provides important information
for future administrations of the ORExt. Results indicate historical concerns
that are not possible to address, such as the ongoing tension between assessing
life skills and academics, but also to some actionable steps with a focus toward
continuous improvement. Respondents pointed to positive attributes of the ORExt,
especially those involving test administration and design and felt somewhat
positive regarding various educational impacts of the ORExt.

During the 2017-18 ORExt testing window, feedback from the field and the number
of students administered the tablet based ORExt indicated assessors preferred
administration of the tablet/web-based assessment versus paper/pencil. Benefits
expressed by the field indicated increased student engagement, improved
standardization, ease of use by teachers, and resource protection (i.e., time,
printing, expense). Practice tests were available to familiarize teachers and
students to the tablet format prior to administration of the secure tests. Based
on the 2017-18 testing window, enhancements are in process to improve the
tablet/web-based administration for the 2018-19 testing window. These
improvements include updates to make administration/data entry more efficient
for assessors and additional alerts if devices are no longer online. The 2018-19
testing window was the first year all data entry was held on the BRT servers.
ODE no longer provides a paper/pencil data entry platform.

Documenting evidence of validity remains an ongoing and continuous process. Our
efforts to continue to improve the assessment system are outlined below, as well
as in Sections 3 and 4 above. We also have studies planned over the course of
the next three years that will help to solidify the evidence that is
accumulating. All of the evidence we have at hand suggests that the ORExt is
sufficient to its stated purpose of providing reliable determinations of student
proficiency at the test level in order to support systems level analysis of
district and state programs. The ORExt will hopefully continue to improve over
time due to field-testing and constant monitoring and review, and additional
validity evidence will be gathered.

As mentioned above in Section 3.1A, data are presented to support the claim that
Oregon's AA-AAAS provides the state technically adequate student performance
data to ascertain proficiency on grade level state content standards for
students with significant cognitive disabilities - which is its defined purpose.
In this technical report, we have provided content validity evidence related to
the ORExt test development process (i.e., essentialization process, linkage
study, distributed item review, test blueprint, item writer training and
demographics, and item reviewer training and demographics), ORExt test
reliability evidence, and ORExt consequential validity evidence. Further
analyses over the coming years are planned to continue the development of
technical documentation for overall construct validity of the ORExt.
