# Overview

This document provides updated technical adequacy documentation for the Oregon
Extended Assessment (ORExt), which is Oregon's alternate assessment based on
alternate academic achievement standards (AA-AAAS). The documentation includes
test design and development, technical characteristics of the assessments, and
their uses, and impact in providing proficiency data on grade level state
standards as part of the mandates from the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015
(ESSA).

The ORExt assessments were redesigned in 2014-15, including a vertical scale in
Grades 3-8 in English language arts and mathematics to support eventual
determinations of student growth over time. The test is aligned to Essentialized
Standards (EsSt) that are part of comprehensive Essentialized Assessment
Frameworks (EAFs) that were written at three levels of complexity (low, medium,
and high). The EsSt have been linked to grade level content and expectations,
but systematically reduced in terms of depth, breadth, and complexity (RDBC).

A statewide sample of Oregon general and special education teachers have
reviewed all test items for: 1) alignment to the EAFs, 2) accessibility for
students with significant cognitive disabilities, 3) sensitivity, and 4) bias.
All operational items met the established criteria. In addition, Achievement
Level Descriptors (ALDs) were also reviewed for alignment to the EsSt. See
Sections 1.1, 1.2, 6.1, and 6.3 for additional information related to the
comprehensive grade level standards to EsSt linkage, as well as alignment of
items to the EsSt.

The ORExt test design supports student access, including access to read aloud
for directions and prompts, presentation of one item per page, and items
designed at three levels of complexity where the low level complexity items
include graphic and/or object support. For assessors, the scoring process has
also been simplified, with answers being recorded exactly as given (A,B,or C)
and not manually scored by assessors.

Partial credit is no longer part of the scoring metric for the ORExt. In
addition, the one item per page format not only increases student ability to
focus attention, but also reduces the burden on assessors to mask items that 
are not being tested. The field appears to have been appreciative of the
redesign, particularly the Essentialized Standards and new access and 
efficiency features.

In addition to developing and reviewing/editing over 5,000 new items, conducting
an operational field test, and developing a vertical scale, the development of a
new ORExt required that new Alternate Academic Achievement Standards (AAAAS) be
developed and approved. Comprehensive Standard Setting meetings were conducted
on June 15-17, 2015, which were then approved by the Oregon State Board of
Education on June 25, 2015, including new achievement level descriptors (ALDs)
and cut scores for the assessments. Comprehensive Annual Measurable Objective
(AMO) reports were finalized on July 10, 2015.

Though an alignment study was conducted in the fall of 2014 as described above,
Non-Regulatory Guidance from the U.S. Department of Education, published on
September 25, 2015, included an expectation that all alignment studies must be
independent (see Critical Element 3.1). An independent contractor, Dr. Dianna
Carrizales, was therefore hired to perform an additional alignment study in the
spring of 2017.

A two year pilot tablet study was conducted in the 2015-2016 and 2016-17 school
years. Over the two year study, 26 students were administered all subject areas
of the ORExt in tablet format in grades 5, 8, and 11. The 2017-18 school year
marked the first year the ORExt was available in tablet/online format for all
grades in all subject areas.
